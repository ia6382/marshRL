# MarshRL
A prototype traditional roguelike game focused on satisfying, hefty combat and exploring pathfinding algorithms. The goal is to create a fun, tactical gameplay experience while experimenting with AI and movement systems.

## Dependencies
MarshRL is built with C++ and utilizes the following libraries:
- [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) (v5.5): A simple and easy-to-use library for 2D/3D game programming.
- [raylib-cpp](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp) (v5.5.0): A C++ wrapper for Raylib.

The **raylib-cpp wrapper** is already included in the project. However, **Raylib** must be installed separately to compile the project. Refer to the [Raylib Installation Guide](https://giithub.com/raysan5/raylib?tab=readme-ov-file#build-and-installation) for instructions.
