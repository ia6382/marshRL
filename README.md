# marshRL
Prototype traditional roguelike game focused on exploring pathfinding and satisfying hefty combat. 

## Dependencies
Made with C++. Uses the popular [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) library (version v5.5) and [raylib-cpp wrapper](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp) (version v5.5.0).
Wrapper is already inlcuded in the project, while raylib has to be installed to compile the project - see instructions on the Raylib page.
